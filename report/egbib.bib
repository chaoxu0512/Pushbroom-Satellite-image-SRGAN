abstract = {In order to scan efficiently along the trace of curve-distributed off-track targets, a novel push-broom imaging method is proposed. Firstly, the trace equation is fitted to optimize the number of detectable targets. To achieve the shortest attitude maneuver time, the triaxial attitude of the satellite is solved in real time, and the TDI imaging velocity is made consistent with the direction of the trace. Finally, the ground imaging simulation is performed, and JL-1 Smart Verification Satellite is utilized to verify that the imaging temporal resolution has been improved by more than 4 times.}
